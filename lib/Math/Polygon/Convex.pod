=head1 NAME

Math::Polygon::Convex - Collection of convex algorithms

=head1 INHERITANCE

 Math::Polygon::Convex
   is a Exporter

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use Math::Polygon::Convex  qw/chainHull_2D/;

 my @points = ( [1,2], [2,4], [5,7], [1,2] );
 my $poly   = chainHull_2D @points;

=head1 DESCRIPTION

The "convex polygon" around a set of points, is the polygon with a minimal
size which contains all points.

This package contains one convex calculation algorithm, but may be extended
with alternative implementations in the future.

=head1 FUNCTIONS

B<chainHull_2D>(POINTS)

=over 4

Each POINT is an ARRAY of two elements: the X and Y coordinate of a point.
Returned is the enclosing convex L<Math::Polygon|Math::Polygon> object.
